Magic Set Editor 2.0.1 from SVN code + Series 10 Yugioh MSE Template 

This is the repo for MSE 2.0.1, Grabbed directly from the source code on their SVN.

The updated code was there for a while, but no one compiled it for some unknown reason.

Well, there need to be a first.
(or second since someone compiled it over at MSE's forums)

This repo also includes all original Magic Templates from the same SVN.

All copyrights are of their respective original author and copyright holders.
